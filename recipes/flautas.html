        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Flautas are a take on the infamous tacos from Mexican
            cuisine. These tacos are rolled tightly and fried,
            giving them the shape of "flutes," hence the name <em>flautas</em>.</p>
        <p>They can be filled with any form of protein or mashed
            potatoes. But, this recipe will include shredded chicken
            as the filling of choice.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Shredded, cooked chicken</li>
            <li>1 cup of shredded cheddar</li>
            <li>1 cup of queso blanco</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. of kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp. of hot sauce (optional)</li>
            <li>10 7" flour tortillas</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of vegetable, canola, or other oil</li>
            <li>For serving: pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine chicke, cheeses, salt, and hot sauce (if using).</li>
            <li>Lay 1 tortilla down on a flat surface. Spread 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture onto the bottom third of the tortilla.
                Roll up tightly and place seam side down on a plate. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and filling.</li>
            <li>In a skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches between
                350-375 degrees F. (A good tip is to hear a sizzle when the food hits the oil.)</li>
            <li>Add 3 of the flautas to the oil, seam side down. Cook, turning every 30 to 60 seconds,
                until golden all over, about 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the flautas to a large paper towel-lined
                plate. Repeat with remaining flautas. Serve immediately with pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole.</li>
