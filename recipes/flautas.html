        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Flautas are a take on the infamous tacos from Mexican
            cuisine. These tacos are rolled tightly and fried,
            giving them the shape of "flutes," hence the name <em>flautas</em>.</p>
        <p>They can be filled with any form of protein or mashed
            potatoes. But, this recipe will include shredded chicken
            as the filling of choice.</p>
